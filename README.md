## Purpose:
Project File: "Implement a Binary Search Tree with the following methods:
- is_empty: Return True if empty, False otherwise.
- __len__: Return the number of items in the tree.
- __str__: Return a string that shows the shape of the tree when printed
- add(item): Add item to its proper place in the tree

- find(item): Return the matched item. If item is not in the tree, return None.
- preorder: Return a list containing the treeâ€™s data in pre-order traversal order
- height: returns the height of the tree (height of the root node)"

main.py and binarysearchtree.py are my own work. All other files were provided.

## Method:
- Create a BST class
- Manipulate BST data via main.py
- Pass all provided unit tests
